    "- **Improving Data Quality:**\n",
    "By removing noise and irrelevant components, the processed data is made clean and consistent.\n",

    "When a dataset is well-preprocessed, it improves feature extraction. Which, in turn improves the performance of NLP models.\n",

    "- **Reducing Complexity:**\n",
    "By narrowing the dataset to relevant text elements, we can reduce the required computational overhead, and make the training of models more efficient.\n"

    "> Adar became known to the peoples of Middle-earth much later in the Second Age, first appearing in a large trench dug by his servant, Magrot, immediately after Arondir's failed attempt to cause a fray and escape. While Arondir is pinned down, having stabbed Magrot in the neck, Lurka orders he be brought to Adar. The \"Lord-father\" then emerges as the Orcs around him bow. He gently tends to the dying Magrot, who had sustained a mortal wound in the Elves' escape attempt, before suddenly ending his suffering with a dagger. As the rest of the Orcs leave, Adar speaks to Arondir, learning the Silvan Elf's birthplace to be in Beleriand. Adar reminisces about his days along the river Sirion, though he evades Arondir's own questions, before releasing Arondir to take a message to the Southlanders taking refuge in the Watchtower of Ostirith: that they may live if they forsake the territory and swear fealty to him. Later, as he watches one of the caged Wargs devouring fresh flesh, Adar is informed by Grugzûk that the Orc Sigil Hilt that they seek is in the watchtower.\n",

When we moved to a fantsy universe, our model did a fairly good job, but faced issues if the text pre-processing had errors (such as incorrect POS tagging). The purpose of showing such a complex task was to examine how important text pre-processing tools are for other downstream tasks.\n",
